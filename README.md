## Tests 

This game was tested using the Catch2 unit testing framework. The main focus of the testing was the Field class, which is responsible for maze generation and pathfinding. <br>

The following tests were performed: <br>

* Maze Creation: Ensuring that mazes are generated correctly with varying sizes. <br>

* Maze Validation: Verifying that the generated mazes are valid and that there are no errors in their structure. <br>

* Longest Path Finding: Testing the ability to correctly identify and track the longest path in the maze. <br>

Unfortunately, memory leak detection could not be performed using Valgrind or Dr. Memory, as they do not support the chip architecture of the development environment.
